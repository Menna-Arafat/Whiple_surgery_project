# Proteomic Profiling of Pancreatic Cancer Patients: Time Series Study Before and After Whipple Surgery
In this study, I applied a network-based analysis to characterize temporal protein dynamics and functional organization.
Implemented Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify co-expressed protein modules, correlating module eigengenes with sample metadata to detect modules associated with temporal progression.
Modules showing significant changes, including the blue module at 7 days post-operation, were analyzed using generalized additive models, and hub proteins with high intramodular connectivity (datKME > 0.85) were identified as central drivers.
Functional interpretation was achieved by integrating the blue module with proteinâ€“protein interaction networks from STRING, followed by enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler and modularity clustering with the Louvain algorithm, revealing pathway modules with crosstalk and coordinated biological activity.
